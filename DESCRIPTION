Package: il.sfa
Type: Package
Title: Integrated Likelihood Stochastic Frontier Model Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ruggero Bellio and Luca Grassetti
Maintainer: Luca Grassetti - University of Udine <luca.grassetti@uniud.it>
Description: This package is a software companion for the paper Bellio and Grassetti (2023) "bla bla bla".
    The functions included in the package il.sfa allows to reproduce the simulations included in the paper. 
    The il.sfa(.) function is used to fit a give set of SF models considering the integrated likelihood approach described in the cited reference.
    The DGP() function reproduce the simulation process described in Belotti et al. (????) and also used in Bellio and Grassetti (2023).
    The package also includes a specific dataset collecting the estimation results obtained using Stata. In particular, sftfe function is used on a simulation set obtained using the DGP function included in the preent package.
