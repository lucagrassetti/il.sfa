Package: il.sfa
Type: Package
Title: Integrated Likelihood Stochastic Frontier Model Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ruggero Bellio and Luca Grassetti
Maintainer: Luca Grassetti - University of Udine <luca.grassetti@uniud.it>
Description: This package is a software companion for the paper Bellio and Grassetti (2023) "Efficient estimation of true fixed-effects stochastic frontier models".
    The included functions allow to reproduce the simulations included in the paper and estimate all the models discussed in it. 
    Inparticular, The il.sfa(.) function is used to fit a given set of SF models considering the integrated likelihood approach described in the cited reference.
    The DGP(.) function can be used to mimic the simulation process described in Belotti and Ilardi (2018) "Consistent inference in fixed-effects stochastic frontier models" and also used in Bellio and Grassetti (2023).
    The package also includes a specific dataset collecting the results obtained using Stata command "sftfe" (including the models discussed in Belotti et al. (201) "Stochastic frontier analysis using Stata"). 
    In particular, sftfe function is used on a simulated dataset generated via DGP function which is also used to manage the simulation studies.
